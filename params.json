Unfortunately, due to the policy of Queen's Game, I am currently unable to make it public on the App store.\r\n\r\nYou can pull and build the project and have it run on your iPad1 or iPad2. The game has two player local and game center modes, and single player versus AI mode.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
