Aton
====

This is an iPad app game for the board game Aton: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19999/aton

After shown to the original game designer Thorsten Gimmler, he loved it and would like it to be in App store. Unfortunately, due to the policy of Queen's Game, I am currently unable to make it public on the App store.

You can pull and build the project and have it run on your iPad1 or iPad2. The game can be run with single player vs A.I. mode as well as two players “pass and play” and game center mode.
